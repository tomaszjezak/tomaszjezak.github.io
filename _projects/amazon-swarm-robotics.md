## Overview

Engineered a **ROS2-based multi-robot control system** for coordinating warehouse robots at Amazon Robotics.

## Key Contributions

### Multi-Robot Control Framework
- Built **ROS2** control architecture for fleet coordination
- Designed for scalable warehouse robot management
- Enabled both individual and synchronized robot commands

### Embedded Systems Development
- Ported **micro-ROS** onto **ESP32** microcontrollers
- Developed custom drivers using **ESP-IDF** framework
- Streamed real-time robot sensor data for monitoring

### Navigation & Localization
- Implemented **localization** algorithms for indoor warehouse environments
- Built **waypoint navigation** system for autonomous robot movement
- Integrated sensor fusion for accurate positioning

### Control Interface
- Designed **PyQt GUI** for robot fleet management
- Support for individual robot control and synchronized swarm commands
- Real-time visualization of robot states and sensor data

## Overview

Research on **autonomous driving in urban environments** at the [Cognitive Robotics Laboratory](https://www.cogrob.org/), UC San Diego, under the supervision of **Prof. Henrik Christensen**.

## Current Work

### Localization & Sensor Fusion
- Evaluating **localization methods** using **LiDAR** and **IMU** fusion
- Developing accurate **vehicle pose estimation** for urban driving scenarios
- Benchmarking different sensor fusion approaches for robustness

### ROS2 Development Stack
- Building complete **ROS2** software stack for autonomous vehicle
- Developing **drivers** and **launch pipelines** for vehicle sensors and actuators
- **Dockerized** deployment for reproducible development and testing

## Research Focus

**Thesis**: Autonomous Driving in Urban Environments

Investigating robust perception and localization systems that enable safe autonomous navigation in complex urban scenarios.

## Technical Stack

`ROS2` `LiDAR` `IMU` `Docker` `C++` `Python` `Sensor Fusion` `SLAM`

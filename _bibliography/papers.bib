  title={Academic Question Answering using Dense Retrieval with Supervised Contrastive Learning},
  author={Jezak, Tomasz},
  abstract={Developed a dense retrieval model for Academic Question Answering utilizing Supervised Contrastive (SupCon) loss — the first application of SupCon to text retrieval. Incorporated hard negative mining during training to enhance model robustness and implemented HNSW for efficient nearest-neighbor retrieval, achieving leaderboard score 0.119 (35th place).},
